I enjoy working with children, and I am passionate about helping developmental
disability children to live a better life. I am interested in behaviroal health filed, including
autism. I am currently working as a Registered Behavioral Technician at Kadiant. My long-term goal is
practically applying ABA therapy to help as many as children I can. With my pursuit of earning my 
Master's degree in Education, I am confident that I can have more knowledge of 
connecting and communicating with diverse populations.
